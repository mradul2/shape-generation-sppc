# Shape Generation Using Spatially Partitioned Point Clouds 

This repository implements the following utilities:

1. Spatially partitioned point cloud
2. PCA
3. Iterative Point Ordering
4. GAN

## Various methods used in the work

### Poisson Disc Sampling



### K Dimensional Tree

Binary search tree in which data in each node is a K-dimensional point in space. 

Building a K-d tree for 3D Data: 

1. Select the initial axis and sort the data according to it, and insert median of that data as the root. 
2. Select next axis based on the increasing depth, as axis = d%k. 
3. Sort the points by the obtained axis and choose median as pivot element, is less then left branch or right branch. 
4. Traverse the tree until all the data points are not inserted. 

Some examples of obtained color map before and after sorting the point clouds:

### Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method to for dimensionality reduction of a dataset and to speed up the applied algorithm.

In this case, we apply PCA on the sorted point cloud by generating a matrix of size 3N x S, where N is number of points in each shape and S is the number of shapes in the dataset. And then perform PCA on the matrix: P = UÎ£V, resulting in the linear shape basis U and projections V. By default, the size of shape basis is chosen to be B = 100. 

Point cloud data before and after changing basis:

### Optimizing point ordering

This method further tries to improve the point ordering done by KdTree sorting. 

Process is as follows: 

```
For I times:
    For each shape in the dataset:
        For K times:
            Choose 2 random points (i, j) in the shape and swap them
            if Reconstruction error decreases: 
                swap(i, j)
    Recompute the PCA basis
```

### Learning Shape Coefficients Using GAN

After obtaining the projected point clouds in the basis U, they are used as the training data to train fully connected GAN. 

Some specifications regarding the GAN training: 

1. Both generator and discriminator are 4-layered fully connected networkd with 100 nodes in each layer. 
2. Each layer is followed by a batch normlaization layer except the last layers. 
3. Discriminator and Generator uses a LeakyReLU and ReLU respectively as the activation functions. 
4. Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.0001 and 0.0025 is used respectively for discriminator and generator.

Instead of using the vanilla loss for the generator, we use the sum of L2 norms of the differences of mean and covariance of the vectorized intermediate generator activations of real and fake data respectively.
